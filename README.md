### Meow meow meow, meow MEOW meow. Miao!

Nominally, a very important app displaying catfetti.

Practically, an exercise in using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to develop & host an [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) demonstration. Future plan: adapt into a Chrome Extension.

## Demo

http://glebec.github.io/catfetti

## Develop

```sh
yarn # cats like yarn
npm run build:dev # starts webpack in watch mode
open dist/index.html
```

## Deploy

```sh
npm run deploy # pushes to gh-pages branch of the repo listed in package.json
```
