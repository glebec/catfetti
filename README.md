# 🐱 Catfetti

### Meow meow meow, meow MEOW meow. Miao!

Nominally, a very important app displaying catfetti.

Practically, an exercise in using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to develop & host an [HTML canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial) demonstration. Future plan: adapt into a Chrome Extension.

npm run build:dev # starts webpack in watch mode
